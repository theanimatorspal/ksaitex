## 📜 What is ksai_TEX?

A document generation engine where Markdown enters and pristine PDFs exit... eventually.  
Built in **Python 3.12+**, enforced by **mypy**, and rendered with the sheer power of **LuaLaTeX**. 

Designed for people who want the power of LaTeX but refuse to write backslashes manually.

You get:

| Feature                  | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🪄 Magic Commands        | `[[MAGIC:Box|title=Chaos]]` -> Beautiful Typeset Box. Like Hogwarts.       |
| 🕉️ Devanagari First      | Sanskrit & Nepali support so good it feels native.                         |
| 🐍 Python Backend        | Strictly typed. No inline comments. No mercy.                              |
| 🎨 Gruvbox UI            | Because staring at white screens is a crime against humanity.              |
| ⚡ Instant Preview       | See your layout break in real-time!                                        |
| 🧩 Template Engine       | Jinja2 inside LaTeX. It’s unholy, but it works correctly.                  |
| 🔒 Atomic Editing        | We track your cursor like a hawk to ensure perfect sync.                   |

> 💸 Whether you’re writing a thesis, a novel, or essentially just generating PDFs to feel productive — `ksai_TEX` supports your delusion.

## 🛠️ Constructing the Machinery

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

We use `uv` because `pip` is too slow for our vibes.

```bash
# Install the chaos manager
pip install uv

# Sync the universe (and dependencies)
uv sync
```

### Step 2: The Font Ritual

Drop your fancy `.ttf` or `.otf` files into the `fonts/` directory.  
If you don't have *Tiro Devanagari Sanskrit*, are you even typing?

```
ksaitex/
├── fonts/
│   ├── TiroDevanagariSanskrit-Regular.ttf
│   └── ...
```

---

## 🚀 Summoning the Daemon

### Option A: The GUI Experience (Recommended)

Fire up the server and the reactive editor.

```bash
uv run ksaitex serve
```

> Open **http://localhost:8000**. Do not look directly at the logs.

### Option B: The CLI (For Robots)

Convert files in the shadows.

```bash
uv run ksaitex convert input.md --output masterpiece.pdf --template base
```

## 🧩 Python + LaTeX + JS = ♥️?

Yes. 
*   **Javascript** handles the frontend editor (Vanilla, no React bloat).
*   **Python (FastAPI)** orchestrates the madness and handles the heavy logic.
*   **LuaLaTeX** does the actual rendering, because we care about typography.

> ☕ Write markdown, compile PDF, refuse to elaborate.

## ✨ Want to Contribute?

Fork the repo. Add a new magic command.  
Fix a regex that parses nested brackets.  
We’ll probably merge it, unless `mypy` yells at us.
